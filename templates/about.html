      <h1>At the Intersection of Shadow & Light</h1>
      <p>
        In a world awash with color, I seek beauty in the subtletiesâ€”the whisper of a form, the hush of a line.  
        My art is a silent conversation between geometry and emotion:  
        each shifting triangle you see is a heartbeat in monochrome,  
        every brushstroke a pause between breaths.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am <strong>Lupin</strong>, a digital alchemist,  
        turning pixels into poetry. Here, black is not the absence of light but its truest expression:  
        an open invitation to dream, question, and feel.
